Hydrogen
========

Hydrogen monte carlo

The final Hydrogen molecule program is molecule.cpp. It can be compiled through the command:

g++ -O3 molecule.cpp -o Molecule

The final program can be executed by:

./Molecule <beta> <r>

Here <beta> is the chosen value for the variational parameter beta, and <r> the distance between the atoms
